## Closest-Pair

# Description

This project implements an algorithm to find the smallest Euclidean distance between a pair of points in a 2D plane. It utilizes both brute-force and divide-and-conquer approaches to efficiently determine the closest pair of points.

# Features

Computes Euclidean distance between two points.

Implements a brute-force approach for small datasets.

Uses a divide-and-conquer algorithm to optimize performance for larger datasets.

Sorts points by x-coordinates and efficiently finds the closest pair.

Includes a main function to demonstrate the algorithm with sample points.
